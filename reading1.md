##Pain vs. Suffering

1. Whatâ€™s your perspective?
This is the first day of code401 and the very last module before I graduate. I am slowly getting exhausted from all the class days and labs that we are having to do, but I cannout let my guard down. My perspective is on the end of the road, but exceling through it!

2. Why are you doing this?
I want to build a career that is fulfilling. I want to provide for my family and enjoy a life of developing the world of technology

3. Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
Yes. I want to be ready to jump into a job and exercise my skills. I want to be confident of what I have learned and advance myself into new opportunnities for my skill set.

4. Are you doing this for you?
I'm not doing it just for me, but for my family and the generations behind me. I want to live a life of financial success and help others with what I have. 

##Big O Notation  Used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithim. 

Here are the types of algorithms from big O

O(1)
This describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

O(N^2) Represents an algorithim whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential
